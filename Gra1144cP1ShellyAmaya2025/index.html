	<img src="alfajores.jpg" />
		<p>These are sweet, shortbread-style cookies. Alfajores (alfajor, singular) are a popular Latin American treat made of two soft, crumbly cookies filled with a creamy dulce de leche spread. This easy recipe is sure to become a fan favorite. </p>

<section><h3>Instructions</h3>
	<ol>
<li>In a bowl, beat &frac34; cup unsalted butter with &frac34; cup sugar just until incorporated.</li>
<li>Add 1 egg, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and &frac14; teaspoon almond extract and beat for 1 minute.</li>
<li>In 2 or 3 parts, add sifted 2 cups all-purpose flour, &frac12; teaspoon baking powder and &frac14; teaspoon salt. You can sift them before or have the ingredients measured and sift them directly over the butter mixture (my choice). It will be a soft but not sticky dough.</li>
<li>Wrap it and chill it for several hours or overnight. It can be in the refrigerator for 2-3 days or frozen for a few weeks (defrost in the refrigerator the day before).</li>
<li>When you are ready to bake the cookies, preheat the oven to 350&deg; F.</li>
<li>Have baking sheets ready; no need to butter or line them with parchment paper, but you can.</li>
<li>Roll the dough in 2 parts and leave the unused piece covered, in the refrigerator. You can use two large pieces of parchment paper or a lightly floured surface to roll the dough.</li>
<li>I put the dough in the middle and roll it between the pieces of paper. The dough is cold but does not crack when stretched.</li>
<li>Chill it again until cold, and use a round cookie cutter to cut cookies. Dip the cutter's edge in flour and shake the excess before cutting (prevents the dough from sticking to the cutter).</li>
<li>Place them on the cookie sheet and bake for about 12 to 15 minutes, until they are dry and just beginning to color. It depends a lot on the thickness of the dough.</li>
<li>Let them cool completely on a metal cooling rack.</li>
<li>Fill half the cookies with a thick layer of dulce de leche. I like it to be as thick as the cookie.</li>
<li>Dust the other half of the cookies with powdered sugar before placing them on top of the filling and pressing lightly to assemble the alfajores.</li>
<li>Eat them and be happy. &#9829; </li>
